Run Program.java inside main.com.app.start package.

You can specify the input file as command line argument else by default the application will pick up Input inside main.com.app.logic package as input file.

Unit Test cases have been written using JUnit.

A sample input file would be like this:

> glob is I
> prok is V
> pish is X
> tegj is L
> glob glob Silver is 34 Credits
> glob prok Gold is 57800 Credits
> pish pish Iron is 3910 Credits
> how much is pish tegj glob glob ?
> how many Credits is glob prok Silver ?
> how many Credits is glob prok Gold ?
> how many Credits is glob prok Iron ?
> how much wood could a woodchuck chuck if a woodchuck could chuck= wood ?

Corresponding output to this would be as given below :

> pish tegj glob glob is 42
> glob prok Silver is 68 Credits
> glob prok Gold is 57800 Credits
> glob prok Iron is 782 Credits
> I have no idea what you are talking about
